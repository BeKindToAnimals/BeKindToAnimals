    <h2 class="header red" id="t1">Adopt don't buy</h2>
    <p>Always adopt a furry family member and never buy one. <strong>NEVER buy a pet from the pet store!</strong> Pet stores often get puppy mill puppies. <strong>Puppy mills are cruel, they stack puppies in crates on top of eachother and their fecies falls onto the puppies below them.</strong> The crates are so small that the dogs cannot turn around and often scratch off their noses so they can move a little. Puppy mill dogs are very timid because they were treated so harshly. <strong>You may think you are rescueing one of them by buying them but you are NOT.</strong> You are only fueling the ever going cycle of puppy mills. By buying one of the puppies you are supporting puppy mills. Puppy mills are just a buisness, they go where they can get the money. <strong>If nobody buys from pet stores, puppy mills will likely go out of buisness or change their buisness in order to follow the money.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Don't buy a dog from a breeder, reputable ones are okay but adopt dogs from shelters instead.</strong> I know it is temping to buy a cute little puppy but they come with a lot of responsibility. <strong>Puppies are a ton of work and they get bigger, and older an you need to make sure you will love them even when they are no longer cute little bundles of fluff.</strong> You should adopt. <strong>Yes, puppies are cute there are tons of dogs dying every day in shelters beause people want puppies. In fact, most of the dogs being euthanized in shelters in Texas are puppies. </strong> Give a dog a second chance and adopt, don't buy a puppy from a breeder.</p>

    <h2 class="header orange" id="t2">End BSL</h2>
    <h4>What is BSL?</h4>
    <p>BSL is breed specific legislation. It is when people make legislation outlawing speific breeds of dogs. Also there is just plain breed discrimination. People have been afraid of Doberman, Rotties, and dogs that look a certain way that they created a classification: Pit Bull. </p>
    <!---New section!--->
    <h2 class="header yellow" id="t3">Pit Bull is not a breed</h2>
    <p><strong>Many people don't know this, Pit bull is not a breed. Nor is "American pit bull terrier."</strong> Pit bull was a slang term created when they used dogs for bull-baiting in pits. Thus the name "pit bull." <strong>People use it for the breeds that were used for bull baiting many of which include: Bulldog mixes, American Staffordshire terrier mixes, and other terrier mixes. If you don't believe me then check the American Kennel Club's website, pit bull is not an akc registered breed. </strong></p>

    <h2 class="header green" id="t4">End Animal Testing</h2>
    <img src="https://www.kasandbox.org/programming-images/animals/cat.png" class="pic" alt="Cute fluffy orange cat">
    <p>Rather than testing on animals we can do things such as computer modeling, micro-dosing, MRI scanning, and in vitro testing. Testing on animals is inhumane. It is not just ice that get tested on often dogs, cats, and other large animals get tested on. There was a pregnant cat who got sold to the factory and she had 8 kittens all of which were injected with a fluid that <strong>killed</strong> all of them. In another case, a cat named Robert had a hole drilled into his skull and got electrodes attached to his brain. Quoting from PETA's website, "At Michigan State University, experimenters cut into catsâ€™ faces, crushed their optic nerves, removed their eyes, and then <strong>killed</strong> them." Animals are also sold to classrooms who disect cats and dogs. Thankfully, not many schools purchase animals to be disected. One lab injected a fluid into a cat and even though the cat had a severly bad reaction to it they injected into the cat again the next day. They put animals through excruitiating pain when they don't even do the same to humans.</p>

    <h2 class="header blue" id="t5">End Dog Fighting</h2>
    <img src="https://www.kasandbox.org/programming-images/animals/dog_sleeping-puppy.png" class="pic" alt="what I think of dog fighting, cute puppy sleeping">
    <p>People get dogs and force them to fight eachother to the death in pits. Dog fighting is illegal but people still do it. I am appalled by how people can enjoy watching such a cruel thing. The dogs that do survive are afraid of humans and agressive because they had to be or they would die. The dogs that survive would also have tons of scars and would be fairly beaten up. the dogs for fighting are raised without any human or dg contact and are often kept outside on a shirt heavy chain. If the fight is not to the death then the owner of the losing dog will often kill them painfully as part of the show. </p>

    <!--End Animal Hoarding!-->
    <h2 class="header purple" id="t6">End Animal Hoarding</h2>
    <p>Animal hoarding is when and individual houses too many pets in their home, which often leads to neglect. They don't provide adequete food and water supply and don't provide sufficient vet care. If you want to have a lot of furry family memebers you can apply for a permit to house more than the District's limit. Also in the case of "the Doghouse" which follows Danny and Ron's shelter. Although they had a lot of dogs in their house, they qualified as an animal shelter so it was allowed.</p>
    <!--Greyhound Racing!-->
    <h2 class="header pink" id="t7">End Greyhound Races</h2>
    <p>Greyhound races are not as popular or common as they used to be but they still exist. Every year if a Greyhound lacks competitiveness or gets injured in a race they are killed, most of them young and healthy. <strong>Thousand of greyhounds are killed every year.</strong> The dogs can get severly injured on the track and even go into cardiac arrest or break their legs or spine. Off the track they have a no better life, they don't get enough food, water, attention, and vet care. Most are sufffering from external parasites such as fleas. Most of them live in warehouse type facilities and often get discarded when they are one and a half to five years. To give perspective, Greyhounds usually live 13 years.</p>
    <!--Horse Slaughter!-->
    <h2 class="header red" id="t8">End Horse Slaughter</h2>
    <img src="https://www.kasandbox.org/programming-images/animals/horse.png" class="pic" alt="Cherry bay horse trotting in grassy field with a halter on.">
    <p>It is not euthanasia. Horses are taken to the slaughter house to be brutaly killed for human consumption. The horses are packed in trucks without food, water, or rest. This process is mean't to kill them and it is a slow painful death. Then they are dismembered and some of the horses are still concious for that part.</p>
